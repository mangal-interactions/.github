# Mangal - a database for species interaction networks

This is the GitHub organisation for [mangal.io](https://mangal.io), an interactive database of species interaction networks. It is maintained by the [Quantitative and Computational Ecology lab](https://poisotlab.io./) at Université de Montréal, and the [Integrative Ecology](https://ielab.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/) at Université de Sherbrooke.

The development of mangal.io is supported by Compute Canada, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Québec Research Fund - Nature and Technology.

## How to access data?

We offer a RESTFUL API (at `https://mangal.io/api/v2/`) to access the datasets, networks, etc, stored in the database. The API can be accessed with Julia or R.

## How to contribute data?

We are in the process of developing templates for submission, via the [contribute](https://github.com/mangal-interactions/contribute) repository, to handle the data contribution process. *In order to facilitate the deposition of data, we will take care of formatting your raw data files*!

Contributing to mangal.io does not require to create an account - if you already have an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/), you can simply visit <https://mangal.io/auth> to be registered in the database.
